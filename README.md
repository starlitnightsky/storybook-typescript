# cra-template-typescript-storybook

This template extends the Create React App [TypeScript template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with Storybook.

### GETTING STARTED

To use this template, add `--template typescript-storybook` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript-storybook

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript-storybook
```

### USAGE

- App and Component directory structure is the same as a standard create-react-app install
- Stories are written in the `src/stories` directory (this can be changed in `.storybook/main.js`)

### MORE INFO

Inspired by this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/shilman/bc9cbedb2a7efb5ec6710337cbd20c0c) by one of the Storybook maintainers to quickly get Storybook Docs, Create React App, and TypeScript up and running. Basically, this template installs all those packages in a simple one-step process.
